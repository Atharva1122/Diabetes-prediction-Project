# Diabetes-prediction-Project
A Power BI dashboard that visualizes health metrics like glucose, BMI, and insulin to analyze and predict diabetes risk. It helps identify high-risk groups using interactive charts, filters, and outcome-based visual insights.
Overview:
This dashboard is designed to analyze and predict diabetes occurrences based on medical attributes of patients. It leverages health-related data to uncover patterns that may lead to diabetes, helping healthcare professionals make informed decisions.

Key Features:

Demographic Analysis: Charts showing patient distributions by age, gender, and BMI categories.

Medical Metrics: Visuals for glucose levels, blood pressure, insulin levels, and diabetes pedigree function to identify key risk indicators.

Prediction Insights: Filters and indicators show the proportion of patients predicted to be diabetic vs. non-diabetic using a model (likely implemented outside Power BI).

Interactive Filters: Slicers for gender, age group, and outcomes to explore different patient segments.

Health Trends: Line/area charts to show correlations among variables like BMI and glucose levels.

Purpose:

Helps understand how certain medical indicators relate to diabetes.

Aids in preventive healthcare strategies by highlighting high-risk profiles.
